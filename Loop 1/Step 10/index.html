  <!-- Welcome to your first FrontLoops challenge. Today we gonna build a neat landing page for Apple Watch. Just try to do your best and use the techniques from previous lessons. Good luck!
    P.S.: If you want some more - try splitting your css into several files (one file for each design element like button, search input etc.) and use @import to get them combined in the main.css file. -->
